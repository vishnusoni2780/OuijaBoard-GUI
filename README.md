# OuijaBoard-GUI
As we all heard about Ouija Board, this project is based on theme of this board & I've integrated it with GUI Based feature which leads to implementation of Tkinter with every operations of Python too.
So, in this I've created different windows based on fields, Speech Recognition Using Python ( which comes under part of AI/ML ), Question-Answering Model with Py Dictionary, User Input, Alert System, Response driven, Separate Dataset.

It sound funny, but implementation a real field to code leads me to gain the knowledge about everything i used in this project.
